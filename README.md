# nutrientModeling
A place to store code (and hopefully data) about modeling nutrient availability from food availability now and in the future. 
- FBSManipulation.R manipulates data from the FAO's Food Balance Sheets. 
- nutrientCalcs.R generates nutrient metrics based on IMPACT model set of commodities.
